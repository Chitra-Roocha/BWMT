                <h2>Student at Curtin Mauritius</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a third-year student at Curtin Mauritius, where I'm majoring in BCom Information and Technology.
                    From a young age, I've always had an interest in technology and its potential to transform the world we live in.
                    My passion for technology and desire to make a difference has driven me to pursue my degree in this field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my academic journey so far, I've acquired a range of skills, including Figma, HTML, CSS, and Python.
                    These skills have enabled me to work on exciting projects and assignments in various aspects of technology,
                    from web development to data analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from my academic pursuits, I have also gained valuable work experience.
                    I worked at EY for three months, where I was involved in developing software solutions for clients. During my internship program at Rogers Capital,
                    I had the opportunity to work with a dynamic team of professionals and gain exposure to different areas of technology.

                    In week one and two, we created an additional webpage using html CSS3.
                    During the third week of my learning journey, I acquired knowledge on Javascript which enabled me to incorporate it along with HTML and CSS to create an enhanced version of the ROCK PAPER SCISSORS(RPS) web page. With the help of Javascript, I was able to make an interactive square that would display a different text message when clicked on.
                    This web page utilized the features of HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.

                    Creating a website with HTML and CSS was a difficult but gratifying process.
                    It was thrilling to see my ideas come to life and to have complete control over the website's design and layout.
                    </p>

                 <p>

                    However, it did need a great deal of time and attention to detail.

                    Understanding the link between HTML and CSS was one of the most difficult things I had to learn.
                    CSS is in charge of styling and appearance, whereas HTML is in charge of structure and content.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It took some effort to figure out how to connect the two and make sure the website looked the way I wanted it to.

                    Despite the difficulties, creating a simple HTML/CSS website was a very satisfying experience.
                </p>

                <p>

                    It gave me a feeling of achievement to see my ideas come to life, and I learned essential skills that I may use to future projects.
                    I'm enthusiastic to keep learning and explore the world of web development.
